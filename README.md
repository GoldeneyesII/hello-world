# hello-world
First repository on github.com! Learning the basics!

Hey all! GoldeneyesII here! I am a new dev. working on github for the first time. I have done several very small projects on my own, but am looking to start sharing my code with others so that I can learn to write faster, more efficient, and just overall better code! For the most part I have been using python3, but I also have some experience with C#, C++, Javascript, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, and a smidge of jQuery. I am primarily a gamer, but also dabble in cyber security as a hobby. Looking forward to what comes from my experiences with github!
